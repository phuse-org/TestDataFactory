# Programming Guidelines
This project, as part of the Standard Analyses & Code Sharing working group, adheres to the same [Good Programming Practices](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/whitepapers/ProgrammingGuidelines.md).

# Contributing
* Github integration is ideal, to allow distributed contributors to collaborate seamlessly. Helpful software:
  * A Github account, of course
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local system
  * [a git interface](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) such as GitHub Desktop, TortoiseGit or another from this list
  
* R software
  * If your enterprise environment provides R and git integration, great!
  * Otherwise, install
    * [R open-source](https://cran.rstudio.com/), and
    * [R Studio open-source](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

* SAS software
  * If your enterprise environment provides SAS and git integration, great!
  * Otherwise, consider setting up [SAS University Edition on a local virtual machine](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition/download-software.html)
  * Yes - it's more difficult than working with open-source R and RStudio
  
# GitHub Flavored Markdown
[GH Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is not always intuitive, but at least it's documented :)

Special notes:
+ blank lines are highly meaningful for line wrapping
+ **Note: 2 spaces (totally invisible!) at end of line forces a line break** ... so don't accidently trim trailing spaces from any GH markdown file!
