## José to present in May, PharmaSUG, on this data synthesis working
   * José will share materials for our info and review

## Workshop based on SDTM Conformance & Compliance provided by José
   * [2021-05-07_Pinnacle21-report.xlsx](docs/2021-05-07_Pinnacle21-report.xlsx)
   * [2021-05-07_CDISC_SDTM_Empty_fields.xlsx](docs/2021-05-07_CDISC_SDTM_Empty_fields.xlsx)
   * [2021-05-07_CDISC_SDTM_Processing_Report.pdf](docs/2021-05-07_CDISC_SDTM_Processing_Report.pdf)
   * Specific topics today included:
     * ensuring consistency of --TERM and --TRT "Topic" vars, and grouping qualifiers such as --CAT vars, and var qualifiers such as --CD vars.
     

# Next Steps
* TDF working sessions to advance conformance (P21) and credibility (clinical perspective)
  * Proceed in data domain order, as previously noted in [minutes from Oct. 23, 2020](2020-10-23.md)
  * José to address Pinnacle21 findings as much as possible with his team
    * cdisc "submission value" vs. "synonym" logic, to use submission values consistently, for example [Ethnicity CT](https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SDTM/SDTM%20Terminology.html#CL.C66790.ETHNIC)
    * CDISC Notes from [SDTMIG, such as DM.DTHFL requiring only a subset (Y or null)](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Demographics) of the non-extensible ["NY" controlled term](https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SDTM/SDTM%20Terminology.html#CL.C66742.NY)
    * logical relationship of vars such as start/end consistency
    * dataset metadata according to SDTMIG, such as var type and labels in SAS xpt files
  * José to record var dependencies and implementation rules along with the domain metadata, like the SDTMIG specs
  * Team to review updates, and queries that José brings to use
