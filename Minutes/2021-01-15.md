## Debrief on recent activities

1. PhUSE discussion from Tues, Jan. 12
   * PhUSE will schedule a discussion about consolidating PhUSE projects TDF, PODR, SEND TDF
   * Dante to share invitation with team
   * Objectives of consolidation
    * Consolidate development efforts/resources for any reasonable overlap, whether conceptual, methodological or technical
    * Establish optimal model for PhUSE software projects, identify ingredients for success, etc.
    * Pursue 2 main approaches:
      * "Synthesis" - the Replica Analytics approach of synthesizing a clinically "equivalent" trial database  by first analyzing an existing one
      * "Data Factory" - simulate data based on user configuration, controlled terminology (CDISC data models), dictionaries, etc.
    * ?? Consider a hybrid approach - Derive configuration from analysis of an existing db, which can then be modified or enhanced for simulation ??

2. José update on PODR python code
   * NIHPO have engaged a full-time python developer
   * Several data domains have already been implemented in the broader project of simulating credible, geographically-located, populations with medical histories
   * Further details / demo in next meeting
   * ( Request to José to supplement minutes with (excerpt?) of the documentation he presented today - in this project, or [PODR](https://github.com/phuse-org/PODR) )

3. Alexey demonstrated [Neo4j graph db](https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/) with a [vueJS framework](https://vuejs.org/)
   * Front-end to collect user configuration and store in graph database
   * Query the db in [Cypher open graph query language](http://www.opencypher.org/?ref=cypher)
