# Discussion Topics

## Debrief on recent activities

2. Conformance and Credibility of NIHPO synthetic data
   * José published in [github a synthetic db for review](https://github.com/nihpo/SynthHealthData/tree/main/synthtrial/SDTM_1000)
   * Alexey provided Pinnacle 21 assessment to the [TDF Teams folder](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/files/General?threadId=19%3A714ea5bb1de740af9f423e470d02d2a6%40thread.tacv2&ctx=channel&context=demo_100_subjects_20210409&rootfolder=%252Fsites%252FTestDatasetFactory%252FShared%2520Documents%252FGeneral%252FNIHPO%2520Test%2520Data%252Fdemo_100_subjects_20210409), which the team reviewed
   

# Next Steps
* TDF working sessions to advance conformance (P21) and credibility (clinical perspective)
  * Proceed in data domain order, as previously noted in [minutes from Oct. 23, 2020](2020-10-23.md)
  * José to address Pinnacle21 findings as much as possible with his team
    * cdisc "submission value" vs. "synonym" logic, to use submission values consistently, for example [Ethnicity CT](https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SDTM/SDTM%20Terminology.html#CL.C66790.ETHNIC)
    * CDISC Notes from [SDTMIG, such as DM.DTHFL requiring only a subset (Y or null)](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Demographics) of the non-extensible ["NY" controlled term](https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SDTM/SDTM%20Terminology.html#CL.C66742.NY)
    * logical relationship of vars such as start/end consistency
    * dataset metadata according to SDTMIG, such as var type and labels in SAS xpt files
  * José to record var dependencies and implementation rules along with the domain metadata, like the SDTMIG specs
  * Team to review updates, and queries that José brings to use
