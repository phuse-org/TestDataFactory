# Agenda & Minutes

invited: Jessica, José, Gabrielle, Dante

excused: Greg, Nancy, Peter, Cindy, Khaled, Alexey

# Discussion Topics

## Parameterization and configuration of data synthesis
   * José walked us through a nascent UI for users to enter parameters of simulation
   * Jessica recommended flagging minimum required parameters, potentially by category - such as TS domain details (which may not always be needed)

## Workshop based on SDTM Conformance & Compliance provided by José
   * Further discussion of MedDRA integration, and potential need by users to incorporate sponsor resources, such as MedDRA coding databases based on free-text terms collected in studies
   * SDTMIG indicates CT variables without an industry standard - sponsor's discretion
     * José demonstrated how the systems parameterizes these, and how users can customize the same sponsor-determined CT lists
   * Future topic: mechanism to define defaults (and users to customize) variable dependencies that contribute to database conformance and credibility 
     * e.g., term, test, parameter and associated code (CD) vars

# Next Steps
* TDF working sessions to advance conformance (P21) and credibility (clinical perspective)
  * Proceed in data domain order, as previously noted in [minutes from Oct. 23, 2020](2020-10-23.md)
  * José to address Pinnacle21 findings as much as possible with his team
    * logical relationship of vars such as start/end consistency
  * José to record var dependencies and implementation rules along with the domain metadata, like the SDTMIG specs
  * Team to review updates, and queries that José brings to us
