# Agenda & Minutes

invited: Peter, Nancy, José, Alexey, Dante

excused: Jessica, Cindy

# Discussion Topics

## Reviewed José's python code for Trial Design Model domains
* See the [PhUSE Open Data Repository sample code](https://github.com/phuse-org/PODR/tree/master/sample_code)

## Revisited Priorities for development
* See for background the [Meeting Minutes from 2020-08-14](./2020-08-14.md)

## "Schedule of Assessment" details - a gap
* A protocol's "Schedule of Assessment" (__SoA__) is not entirely represented in SDTM domains

  * Details are required to simulate timing of events (e.g., AE), interventions (e.g., EX), findings (e.g., LB)
  * The TDF team must fill these SoA gaps as needed to progress the simulation
  
* Create an _SoA structure_ for these details, as needed
  * See approach outlined in _Minimum var?_, below
  * We need a mock study design to guide this configuration, as well as the Trial Design domains, in general
  * Use the simple mock study that we have defined in our workbook [TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsm workbook](../TrialDesign-Tool/TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsm)
    * Preserve flexibility of study/simulation configuration while defining and implementing the simulation of this particular study.

## Agreed prioritization moving forward
* Data domains, prioritized:
  * DM - An SDTM ["Special Purpose"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Models+for+Special+Purpose+Domains) domain
  * AE - SDTM ["Events"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Models+for+Events+Domains) domains
    * DS, MH, ... can follow, as needed
  * EX - SDTM ["Intervention"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Models+for+Interventions+Domains) domains
    * CM, ... can follow, as needed
  * LB - SDTM ["Findings"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Models+for+Findings+Domains) domains
    * VS, EG, ... can follow, as needed
  * SDTM ["Trial Design"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Trial+Design+Model+Datasets) domains - See for example the ["Trial Design Matrix for TDF"](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/master/TrialDesign-Tool), either the macro or non-macro xls file.
    * As mentioned above, use the simple mock study that we have defined in our workbook [TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsm workbook](../TrialDesign-Tool/TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsm)
    * TS - ["Trial Summary"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Trial+Summary) records study attributes useful for synthesizing data
    * TA - ["Trial Arms"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Trial+Arms) details the study arms
    * TV - ["Trial Visits"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Trial+Visits) details the planned visits within each arm

* Flexibility of simulation
  * __Objective:__ Balance variety of SDTM domains simulated, with flexibility of simulation within each of those domains
  * Add vars to Trial Design domains as needed
  * Add schedule of assessments settings *not otherwise recorded in SDTM* into a _Schedule of Assessments_ structure
  * Add simulation settings *not otherwise recorded in SDTM* into a _TDF Configuration_ structure
    * E.g., see the TDF_Configuration tab of our [TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsm workbook](../TrialDesign-Tool/TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsm)

* Mininum vars?
  * Create min required vars, step-by-step
  * Refer either to the [SDTMIG (link to v3.3)](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html), or our workbook [04_MV-DB Specs_SDTMIG3.3.xlsx](../WorkingDocs/04_MV-DB%20Specs_SDTMIG3.3.xlsx) for "Required" vars
    * E.g., for DM, start with vars STUDYID, DOMAIN, USUBJID, SUBJID, SITEID, SEX, COUNTRY
    * As needed while simulating subsequent domains, add any required vars to DM, etc.
    * For example, "RF*" reference date vars for the DM domain

# Next Steps
* TDF team to review & recommend improvements to "minimum viable" db domain specifications assembled in ["04_MV-DB Specs_SDTMIG3.3.xlsx"](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/master/WorkingDocs)
* José to assess, progress implementation, raise (log?) any queries or clarifications needed.
  * With momentum, we could progress this query/clarify dialog between bi-weekly meetings, as well. 
  * Bi-weekly working sessions would then confirm implementation, and any difficult details.
