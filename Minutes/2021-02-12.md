# Discussion Topics

## Debrief on recent activities

1. PhUSE Working Group working session
   * PhUSE created a [Teams channel for Synthetic Data Cross Collaboration](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ae503c714e0094501a0cf640a0ef33ab2%40thread.tacv2/Synthetic%2520Data%2520Cross%2520Collab?groupId=889726b0-fa9b-496e-8a17-7237e9d8cecb&tenantId=2e09e1c5-5c3d-4bca-97c4-573a5695f550) discussions
     * including PODR, SEND TDF, our Clinical TDF, and Roche Synthetic Data reps
     * See the file "PHUSE - Compare Synthetic Data Projects.xlsx" in Teams, for project comparison
   * A brief series of discussions will wrap up on Tues, March 2
     * all TDF members now have that invitation
     * decision on whether or not to consolidate projects, or
     * at least to keep in touch and collaborate on some elements

2. Variation on TDF approaches
   * TDF have been designing a config file, and syntax for specifying a clinical database from scratch.
   * Replica Analytics (RA) build a model of an existing database, and then use that model to create an entirely synthetic database.
   * A variation on TDF current approach would harness RA analysis
   * to generate a databased configuration file
   * human and machine readable
   * which could be modified and extended
   * to generate a novel, entirely synthetic database for different purposes
   * ==> Explore feasibility of this collaboration and coordination

3. José update on NIHPO/PODR API for simulated patient medical history
   * By early March, NIHPO will release the public APIs for many fundamental blocks of EHRs
   * This includes simulating patients, build up from those fundamental blocks
   * He is interested to engage software & data analysis groups to test/feedback/guide further development

# Next Steps
* PhUSE Synthetic Data Cross Collaboration discussion wrap-up
* Release of NIHPO APIs, as basis for generating synthetic CDISC data
  * Consider: TDF session on NIHPO API - bring together potential early users / feedback
* Further work on configuration/syntax for defining a clinical trial database
