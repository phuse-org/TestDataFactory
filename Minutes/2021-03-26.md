# Discussion Topics

## Debrief on recent activities

1. PhUSE Synthetic Data Cross Collaboration discussion wrap-up
   * DDT to draft in TDF github, a survey of current state of these projects
   * Long-term, once tools are mature, build a database of bespoke synthetic databases

2. José updated on NIHPO/PODR API for synthetic clinical platform
   * Pending announcement/publication to PhUSE of the NIHPO synthetic data platform (API)
   * TDF working session moving forward will focus on bi-direction questions & guidance
     * NIHPO development team to bring queries to TDF team, e.g., on requirements for domains/variables
     * NIHPO dev team to run Pinnacle 21 against synthetic data
     * TDF team to review data sets, and P21 reports to highlight aspects to address/improve
     * Workshops to be organized in advance around specific data domains
     * Objective: increasing conformance, and then credibility of synthetic datasets and databases

# Next Steps
* PhUSE Synthetic Data Cross Collaboration discussion wrap-up
* Release of NIHPO APIs, as basis for generating synthetic CDISC data
  * Consider: TDF session on NIHPO API - bring together potential early users / feedback
* Further work on configuration/syntax for defining a clinical trial database
