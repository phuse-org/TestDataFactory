# Discussion Topics

## Tasks and activities moving forward
* Feedback on container/docker product
  * con: unable to install on company machines
  * alternative: purely web interface, also potentially blocked by corporate rules
  
* Feedback on web portal http://portal.nihpo.com/index
  * organization of collected information
    * protocol details
    * involved standards / versions
    * simulation configuration
    * data domains of interest
    * etc.
  * recording that in human/machine readable format, simple structured mark-up (e.g., yaml)

* Credibility rules, above & beyond conformance, such as implemented by Pinnacle 21
  * recording that in human/machine readable format, simple structured mark-up (e.g., yaml)
  * to express relationships between 
    * patient records,
    * protocol objectives & incl./excl. criteria
  * vs.
  * allow users to specify valid values for desired data domains
    * random by default
    * tune/tweak specific elements
    * for example 5% of enrolled participants have a specific past surgery, rest of participant have random MHx
      * timing could be completely random, but also tuned further
    * user ability to build up complexity as needed
  

# Next Steps
* TDF working sessions to advance conformance (P21) and credibility (clinical perspective)
  * Proceed in data domain order, as previously noted in [minutes from Oct. 23, 2020](2020-10-23.md)
  * José to address Pinnacle21 findings as much as possible with his team
    * logical relationship of vars such as start/end consistency
  * José to record var dependencies and implementation rules along with the domain metadata, like the SDTMIG specs
  * Team to review updates, and queries that José brings to us
