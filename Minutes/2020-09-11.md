# Reviewed prior next steps
* see also [minutes from last week](./2020-08-28.md)
* Design Q: How could a user configure study milestones? The TDMatrix, above, does not include full protocol details for study design, schedule of assessments, etc. So some SDTM elements such as disposition elements are not yet represented ...
* Design Q: More generally, Graph DB as internal structure for complex data relationships? [PhUSE Data Engineering](https://www.phusewiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Data_Engineering) project could be helpful contacts. 
  * Alexey could explore and work with José and Peter.

* Review additional queries which José will post to the team for review
* *Suggestion:* Post Q&A log to a file like [Simulation Q&A.xls](../TrialDesign-Tool/Simulation-Q-and-A.xlsx), so that we can consolidate the clarifications and any decisions.
