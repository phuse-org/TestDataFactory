* Design Q: How could a user configure study milestones? The TDMatrix, above, does not include full protocol details for study design, schedule of assessments, etc. So some SDTM elements such as disposition elements are not yet represented ...

* Review additional queries which José will post to the team for review
* *Suggestion:* Post Q&A log to a file like [Simulation Q&A.xls](../TrialDesign-Tool/Simulation-Q-and-A.xlsx), so that we can consolidate the clarifications and any decisions.
