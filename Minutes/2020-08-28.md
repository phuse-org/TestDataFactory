# Agenda & Minutes
attended: Jessica, José, Peter, Dante

excused: Nancy, Cindy, Khaled

# Reviewed Targets & Queries
* Targets for "minimum" viable study db
  * Agreement: Consider REQ/EXP "CORE" vars - simulate "Required" vars; create "Expected" but can be empty initially
  * Action (Jessica - done): Extract summary of AE MedDRA terminology from [TDF SDTM pilot package](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/master/Updated/TDF_SDTM) AE domain, as starting point for simulating MedDRA terminology
  * Action (Team): Establish study design for simulation
    * Review updated [Trial Design Matrix](../TrialDesign-Tool/TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsm), which should represent a three-arm parallel study (Investigational/Comparator/Placebo). *Please correct, as needed,* to provide reasonable guidance for implementation of dependent db elements
    * Review [CDISC SDTMIG Experimental Design details & examples](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Experimental+Design+TA+and+TE+)

# Next Steps
* Design Q: How could a user configure study milestones? The TDMatrix, above, does not include full protocol details for study design, schedule of assessments, etc. So some SDTM elements such as disposition elements are not yet represented ...

* We covered José's questions for several domains today
* But there are more :) which José will post to the team for review
* *Suggestion:* Post Q&A log to a file like [Simulation Q&A.xls](../TrialDesign-Tool/Simulation-Q-and-A.xlsx), so that we can consolidate the clarifications and any decisions.
