# Agenda & Minutes
attended: Jessica, José, Peter, Dante
excused: Nancy, Cindy, Khaled

# Reviewed Targets & Queries
* Targets for "minimum" viable study db
  * Agreement: Consider REQ/EXP "CORE" vars - simulate "Required" vars; create "Expected" but can be empty initially
  * Action (Jessica): Extract summary of AE MedDRA terminology from [TDF SDTM pilot package](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/master/Updated/TDF_SDTM) AE domain, as starting point for simulating MedDRA terminology
  * Action (Team): Establish study design for simulation
    * Review updated [Trial Design Matrix](../TrialDesign-Tool/TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsm), which should represent a two-arm parallel study. *Please correct, as needed,* to provide reasonable guidance for implementation of dependent db elements
    * Review [CDISC SDTMIG Experimental Design details & examples](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Experimental+Design+TA+and+TE+)

# Next Steps
    * We covered José's questions for several domains today
    * But there are more :) which José will post to the team for review
    * *Suggestion:* Post Q&A log to a file like [Simulation Q&A.xls](../TrialDesign-Tool/Simulation-Q-and-A.xlsx), so that we can consolidate the clarifications and any decisions.
