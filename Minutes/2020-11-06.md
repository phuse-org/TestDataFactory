# Agenda & Minutes

invited: Jessica, Peter, Nancy, Alexey, Dante

# Discussion Topics

## Further building on Prioritization discussions from
* [2020-10-09](./2020-10-09.md)
* [2020-10-23](./2020-10-23.md)
* Objective: Formalize the requests between the 
  * front-end (collection of user inputs), and 
  * back-end (simulation of CDISC data domains)
* Action for all - Review the workbook [04_MV-DB Specs_SDTMIG3.3.xlsx workbook](../WorkingDocs/04_MV-DB%20Specs_SDTMIG3.3.xlsx)
  * Can we use the "TDF Notes" column, discussed recently, instead for "TDF Inputs" to identify the information required to simulate each domain
  * Then describe these "inputs" as an interface - a function call to the back-end.
  * This could document the contract or interface between front-end/back-end

# Next Steps
* Peter will check whether [WPS Community](https://www.worldprogramming.com/try-or-buy/editions/) could be used for back-end SAS code
  * would allow SAS-developers to contribute according to interfaces, defined above
* Alexey, next meeting, will walk us through his work on a graph db approach
