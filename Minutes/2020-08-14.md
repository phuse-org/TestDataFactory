# Review - Peter's web interface to José's python code
* https://www.80-20-agile.com:8443/vca/login
* Alternative direct access:<br>https://71.77.65.32:8443/vca/login
* Currently this produces data sets defined by sample ADaM specifications that PhUSE/Roche (C. Price) provided to José
* Reviewed target contents for "minimum viable" study db:
  * Based on [TDF SDTM pilot package](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/master/Updated/TDF_SDTM)
  * Access dataspecs in a local clone of this repo:
    * The "define.xml" with "define2-0-0.xsl" presentation
  * Data domains:
    * DM - An SDTM ["Special Purpose"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Models+for+Special+Purpose+Domains) domain
      * __Note:__ Additional "Special Purpose" domains like "Subject Elements" (SE) and "Subject Visits" (SV) consolidate each subject's actual experience in the trial.
    * AE, DS, MH - SDTM ["Events"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Models+for+Events+Domains) domains
    * CM and EX - SDTM ["Intervention"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Models+for+Interventions+Domains) domains
    * LB, VS - SDTM ["Findings"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Models+for+Findings+Domains) domains
    * SDTM ["Trial Design"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Trial+Design+Model+Datasets) domains - See for example the ["Trial Design Matrix for TDF"](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/master/TrialDesign-Tool), either the macro or non-macro xls file.
      * TS - ["Trial Summary"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Trial+Summary) records study attributes useful for synthesizing data
      * TA - ["Trial Arms"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Trial+Arms) details the study arms
      * TV - ["Trial Visits"](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-3/html#Trial+Visits) details the planned visits within each arm
  * Mininum - SDTM "Required" variables (CORE attribute)
    * Min Viable? - Include "Expected" judiciously :)
    * See domain specifications assembled in ["04_MV-DB Specs_SDTMIG3.3.xlsx"](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/master/WorkingDocs)

# Next Steps
* TDF team to review & recommend improvements to "minimum viable" db domain specifications assembled in ["04_MV-DB Specs_SDTMIG3.3.xlsx"](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/master/WorkingDocs)
* José to assess, progress implementation, raise (log?) any queries or clarifications needed.
  * With momentum, we could progress this query/clarify dialog between bi-weekly meetings, as well. 
  * Bi-weekly working sessions would then confirm implementation, and any difficult details.
