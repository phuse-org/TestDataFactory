# Discussion Topics

## Year-end wrap-up & looking forward

We discussed approaches and progress this year, assessed our current state and settle on this communication to relevant WG leads: [Data Transparency > Synthetic Data](http://52.255.142.186:8090/display/WEL/Synthetic+Data) project; and our [DV & OST > TDF](http://52.255.142.186:8090/display/WEL/Test+Dataset+Factory) project.

1.	Consolidation of similar PhUSE projects could make better use of scarce resources

    * Synthetic Data,
    * TDF, and the
    * "SEND Data Factory" project that we chatted with in Mar/Apr this year.

2.	TDF status summarizing backend/frontend concept, as initiated, but slow progress without substantial development resource (tough for volunteers, otherwise professionally engaged, to commit).

3.	Consider the team/resource models that work best, and if there is a software development group that is progressing a product, help us learn from that example

4.	Regarding effective team models, does PhUSE still engage university partners? Partnering with some biopharma analytics/tech programs, interested in some practical project experience, could bring requisite development resources to a consolidated data synthesis/simulation software project.

This may actually break down better into two separate messages: the first 2 points to those WG leads; the 2nd 2 points may be more suitable for [overall PhUSE leads](http://52.255.142.186:8090/display/WEL/Working+Groups)

# Next Steps
* Team to review the message outline, above
* In one week, Dante to send message to relevant WG leads
